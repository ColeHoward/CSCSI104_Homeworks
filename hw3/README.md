I couldn't get my stringparser to work. Conceptually, 
I iterated through the string until I reached a closed 
parenthese. Then, I began iterating backwards util I found an
open parenthese, evaluating the expression along the way. 
I think my problem arose when trying to store the answer in the stack...
