###Question 3
1. A map with a string with the album name and the track number would be the
key, and the song name would be the value would work best. This way, the user
 could input the album name and the track number and find the correct song in
 O(1).
2. This data type would obviously require order so that the recipe is valid. 
Therefore, a list of strings that contain each step in the correct order would 
suffice. 
3. The file extensions have no inherent order or duplicates. If each file 
extension was represented by set of the programs that can read it, you could 
see what kind of files can be read with more one kind of program through the 
intersection operation. Or you easily could also see what programs can read one 
kind of file but not another.  
4. The only reason I can think that this information would be useful is if you
 wanted to see what channel has which station. Since each station has a number 
 associated with it, we want a data type with order. Therefore, a list of strings
  of the tv station names would be useful. This way, you could get the name of a 
  station based on the given Channel (index). You could also return the channel 
  number given the string name using the find function. Although you could also 
  do these things with a map, the order matters. This way you could see that all 
  the news stations are close together or all the movie channels are close 
  together or not, making a list better than a map.
